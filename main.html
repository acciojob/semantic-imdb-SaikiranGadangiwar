		<h2>Summary</h2>
		Sivaji and Ashok are the sons of Parvati. Sivaji is her stepson, but Parvati shows equal affection for both of them.
		 This is not liked by Ashok, her biological son. They are one of the families living on the coast of Sri Lanka. 
		 One day, these villagers are forced to evacuate the coast. By Ashok's dislike on Sivaji,
		  he lies to his mother that Sivaji died in the fire that was burning everything. 
		  Then, he is separated from his family. He ends up in a different boat and lands in Vizag port. He is brought up in the port itself, 
		  but his search for his mother never ceases. In that process, he comes across Neelu. Here,
		   the port is dominated by Baji Rao and some goons using refugee labor for their own gain.
		    Sivaji is an aggressive guy but is controlled by his well-wishers. One day, he reacts aggressively in defense of himself and the other refugees.
			 People start calling him Chhatrapati. Meanwhile, Ras Bihari comes down to Vizag in the hunt for Sivaji since he killed his brother Baji Rao. Ashok,
			  too lands in the same place. Realizing that Sivaji is his brother, he joins hands with the bad guys. The story is then of Chhatrapati,
			   who is searching for his mother, and has a bunch of bad guys, including his brother, 
			   on his back while the entire port looks up to him.
